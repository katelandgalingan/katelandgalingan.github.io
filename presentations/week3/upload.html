      <div class="text"><strong>Minimalism</strong> is the art of creating a website that is simple, pleasing, easy on the eye, and free of clutter. It should look clean, professional, yet catches people's attention. It is highly structured and follows strict rules. Things that should be considered in a <strong>minimalist</strong> website:</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Colours
        </li>
        <li>
          Fonts
        </li>
        <li>
          Graphics
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- <img src="colour.jpg" alt="Colours">

    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="text">Many believe that <strong>minimalism</strong> is the way to go. It is common in professional institutions as well as trendy websites. Some people live by the idea of <strong>minimalism</strong> and would die for the cause.</div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="text">For instance, there is even an organization that is trying to make cluttered websites illegal in Canada. They call themselves Alliance for <strong>Minimalist</strong> Websites or AMW for short. They consider themselves progressive and want to push for <strong>minimalist</strong> website standards. Some of their policies include:</div>
      <ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li>
        No more than two typefaces per webpage
      </li>
      <li>
        Dual colour schemes
      </li>
      <li>
        Only lines for shapes
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p>
      <div class="text">In conclusion, <strong>minimalism</strong> is not only a mode of design for the web developer. It is a lifestyle choice. Once you get into <strong>minimalism</strong>, there is no turning back.</div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="text">It's time to make a positive change in your life.
